### Test plan, maximum points: 8:

Here are five criterias for grading the task. Each criteria has one or more sub-criterias (grouped together, each sub-criteria is separated by an extra empty line). You should pick ONE line from each sub-criteria, picking the line which describes the student's work most accurately. If the text is unclear or ambiguous assume that the content is missing.

The final grading should consist of each Criteria (topic) and the best matching sub-criteria lines. Remember to add the whole sub-criteria line, including the points listed in the beginning of the line.

Finally, write a brief summary of the grading, called "Summary", highlighting the positive and negative aspects of the work, based on the grading criteria. Do NOT use numbered list for the summary.




### Criteria 1: Cover, definitions/acronyms, references and introduction (0.5 points)

0 Document contains a cover page.
-0.1 Document does NOT contain a cover page.

0 The document contains a List of acronyms (or terms).
-0.1 The document does NOT contain a List of acronyms (or terms).

0 The document contains a references section or chapter.
-0.1 the document does NOT contain a referenences section.

0.5 The document contains an introduction section or chapter. The introduction describes the purpose of the document, which is to describe the a test plan for an e-commerce application. The introduction briefly explains the contents of the document.
0 The document does NOT contain an introduction section OR the introduction section is lacking. 


### Criteria 2: Skenaariot / Scenarios (2.5 points) 

0.5 Minimum of 3 of end-to-end scenarios have been defined in the plan.
0 Scenario descriptions have been defined in the plan, but there could be more of them.
-1 No end-to-end scenarios have been defined in the plan, despite the assignment requirements.

1 The scenarios take into account the application descriptions given in the assignment instructions. Common use cases (e.g. shopping cart or product search) are included. The scenarios are described in-detail, and are not only (bulleted) lists with one or two-line explanations.
0.5 Scenarios have been defined in the plan, but they do not seem to consider the application requirements for an e-commerce store described in the assignment instructions.

1 The end-to-end scenarios utilize formal description methods such as UML diagrams.
0.5 The scenario descriptions are OK, but it would have been better to utilize formal description methods (e.g. UML diagrams).
0 The scenario descriptions are clearly lacking. No diagrams or illustrations of any kind are presented.


### Criteria 3: Testing environment and tools (1 point)

0.5 At least 5 to 10 tools and/or testing environments have been included in the plan. There is a brief documentation of each tool or environment intruducing the tools.
0.25 The plan lists tools, but the documentation for the tools is lacking.
-1 No tools or environments have been tested, and the document contains no descriptions of testing tools.

0 The students have tested the tools they have chosen, and these tests are documented in the plan.
-0.25 Based on the documentation it is unclear if and how the students have tested the chosen tools.

0.5 The plan explaines how the tools are to be used in the testing. The plan describes in-detail how the tools will be used to test the phases of the end-to-end scenarios described in the plan.
0 The tools and testing environments have been described in the plan, but the plan does elaborate how these tools will be used to test the scenarios listed in the plan.

### Criteria 4: Tested components and functions (2.5 points)

0.5 The plan lists 10 javascript files from the provided library that will be tested.
0 The list of files to be tested is unclear or lacking.
-1 There is no list of files to be tested included in the plan.

1 The plan explains why these specific files where chosen. A formal and well-known prioritization method (e.g., MoSCoW) has been used to validate file selections. The plan explains in-detail how the method has been used.
0.5 The plan explains why the files were chosen, but it does not utilize a well-known method (e.g. MoSCoW).
0.5 The plan explains why the files were chosen using a well-known method, but based on the documentation it is unclear how the files relate to the end-to-end scenarios defined in the plan.
0 The files selection have not been reasoned The plan does not use a prioritization method or explain the file selections.

1 The testing plan considers the wider aspects of testing. The plan explains what forms of testing (e.g., integration, performance, user) should be performed for the e-commerce application. There a separate sections included in the plan for the testing forms, and the descriptions contain more than one or two sentences.
0 The testing plan is limited to only a narrow testing scope. For example, the plan only considers unit tests.


### Criteria 5: Test Pass criteria(s) (1.5 points)

0.5 The classification of issues and bugs seems clear and reasonable. The classification includes a bug categorization, priority or severity categorization. The documentation uses a clear numeric (e.g., 1-5) or constant-based categorization (e.g., minor, medium, major). The individual categories are clearly explained in the plan.
0 The plan bug or issue categorization description are unclear. The classification of issues and bugs in the numeric format or as constants are missing.
-0.5 No classification for detected issues and bugs is included in the plan.

0.5 The plan explains when individual tests have passed testing. For unit tests, fail/pass criterias are accepted. If other testing forms are descripted, their pass criteria must be reasonable.
0 The plan does not explain when individual tests have passed testing or the documentation is unclear.

0 The pass criteria for the library/test target as a a whole is OK. The documentation describes if all testa are required to be passed, what kind of code coverage is required, and if any kind of bugs can remain (e.g. minor ones).
-0.25 The pass criteria for the library/test target as a whole is missing.

0,5 There is a template for bug and issue reports provided in the plan. The template includes crucial details required for documenting issues.
0 The plan is missing a template for documenting detected bugs ands issues. The plan does not clearly explain how to document findings of the tests.
